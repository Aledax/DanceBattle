For instructions on using this SD card image, please refer to the "Running an ARM Program from an SD Card" section of the "Intel FPGA Monitor Program Tutorial for ARM" tutorial.

This SD card image contains the UBoot preloader and bootloader. The preloader initializes the hardware, then launches the bootloader. The bootloader looks at the FAT32 partition of the SD card, for the following files:

fpga.rbf
program.bin
setup_environment.bin
set_vbar.bin

The fpga.rbf file is the FPGA programming file, generated by the Intel FPGA Monitor Program (or Quartus). The bootloader automatically programs the FPGA using this file.

program.bin is the binary of the baremetal program to be executed. Upon programming the FPGA, the bootloader loads this binary into memory and executes it.

setup_environment.bin is a file generated by the Intel FPGA Monitor Program. This file tells the bootloader some details about the program like the entry point to the program and whether to program the FPGA (not all projects use the FPGA).

set_vbar.bin is a program that is executed by the bootloader before the user baremetal program. This program sets the vector base address register to correspond to  the location of the vector table in the baremetal program. Note that as of 16.0, Intel FPGA Monitor Program forces the vector table to be at location 0x0 in memory.
